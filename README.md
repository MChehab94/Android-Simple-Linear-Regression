A simple linear regression using TensorFlow model created using python.   
The model was created from this [repo](https://github.com/MChehab94/TensorFlow_Simple_Linear_Regression).  
The TensorFlow code was taken from this [repo](https://github.com/curiousily/TensorFlow-on-Android-for-Human-Activity-Recognition-with-LSTMs) and adjusted for the linear regression model accordingly.
